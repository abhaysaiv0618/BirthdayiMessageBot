# Birthday iMessage Bot - by Abhaysai Vemula

Purpose:
The purpose of this program is to run through an Excel file containing information on my friends and family's birthdays & if they have an iPhone send them a "Happy Birthday Message". If they do not this program will send me a reminder that it is their birthday.


I created this program using Python & Excel, utilizing the following Libraries: openpyxl, datetime, an imessage shortcut & library. This program is scheduled on my computer utilizing CronJob.

I will make an updated version of this program that will utilize SQL databases and have additional features
